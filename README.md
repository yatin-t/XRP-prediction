XRP Price Prediction
This project predicts XRP cryptocurrency prices using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model.

Project Structure
• EDA.ipynb – Main notebook with code and visualizations
• Report.pdf – Detailed project report
• Dataset – Historical XRP/USD data (2017–2025)
• Models – Saved LSTM model (if applicable)

Steps Involved
1. Data Collection and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering (MA, RSI, MACD, etc.)
4. LSTM Model Training and Evaluation
5. Visualization and Insights

Libraries Used
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn

Results
The model achieved low validation loss and produced predictions closely aligned with actual XRP prices.

Future Scope
Future improvements include trying hybrid models (GRU/Transformer) and integrating sentiment analysis for enhanced performance.
